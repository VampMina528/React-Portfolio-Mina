      <title>Aspiring Software Developer</title>

        As a dedicated and detail-oriented professional transitioning into software development, I bring a strong foundation in Full Stack Development alongside extensive experience in administrative and aerospace roles. My background has equipped me with a unique combination of problem-solving, analytical thinking, and adaptability—qualities essential for success in a dynamic tech environment.
        <p></p>
        Currently, I am enrolled in the Full Stack Software Development program at the University of Kansas, where I am gaining proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, Object-Oriented Programming, Schema, Render, and Prompt Engineering. My coursework and personal projects have strengthened my ability to build, troubleshoot, and optimize web applications, and I am eager to apply these skills in a professional setting.
        <p></p>
        Prior to my transition into tech, I held roles in aerospace quality inspection and executive administrative support. These experiences refined my technical writing, data analysis, and project management skills—allowing me to thrive in detail-driven environments where precision and efficiency are paramount. My ability to manage documentation, coordinate cross-functional teams, and maintain compliance with rigorous industry standards will translate seamlessly into software development, where accuracy and structured problem-solving are critical.
        <p></p>
        I am particularly excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team as I pursue a full-time, remote software development position. I am confident that my technical skills, combined with my background in process improvement and organization, will allow me to make a meaningful impact on your team.
        <p></p>
        Thank you for your time and consideration. I welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills align with your teams needs.
               </p>
